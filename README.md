Generating CMB foregrounds from simulations using GANs

Simulations of CMB foregrounds are an key resource in understanding and removing CMB foregrounds from the CMB map. However, simulations are computationally expensive and time consuming. To produce CMB foreground maps, generative adversarial networks can be trained on an initial batch of 2D CMB foreground simulation maps to generate indepedent 2D maps.

This repository contains code for training a GAN model to generate N gaussian blobs.
